# Multiplicative Persistence Calculator

This program was made to make it easy to find the multiplicative persistence of any given integer
using Pascal and the FPC compiler.

In order to get the compiler and run the tests you can go to the page https://www.freepascal.org/ and 
download the adequate compiler base on your OS. Once you have the compiler use the command "fpc PersistenceProgram"
to recompile and the command "PersistenceProgram" to run the tests.
